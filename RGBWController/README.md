This folder contains the firmware and Device Handler to control an RGBWW controller with custom pins in SmartThings. The bin firmware for the file can be uploaded directly (and the source is available if you want it to check). The device handler can be updated over the top of your existing one.

In the near future I will push these changes to Eric (@erocm123) but currently hosted here during testing and as I dont have access to push changes.
